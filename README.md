# Spring + Hibernate project
## This is simple project for a course at my university. It is not 'the best project in the world' but it works.
### The main idea of the project: the user is able to create his own event (choose his own options) via web site (in this case localhost), and everything is stored in the database.

- The project was made in polish language because that was requirement of my teacher - I know that this is not the best practice but how can you argue with the requirements
- The database that was used in this project is H2 
- There are diagrams in the folder that should clarify the idea of the project
- The simple GUI (using Thymeleaf) was made for one activity - look activity diagram
- DataBase was made with the CodeFirst method using SpringBoot framework
